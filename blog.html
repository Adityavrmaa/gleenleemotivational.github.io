                        <p>Solid project implementation is necessary for small businesses to build, grow and scale.
                            However, many small businesses
                            don’t have the resources or manpower to hire a project manager, who is solely responsible
                            for managing projects. As a result,
                            many employees are expected to multi-task and complete “duties as assigned.” This process
                            can be a nightmare in an ever-changing
                            environment with impeding priorities and limited resources. Some employees adapt and excel,
                            but many will struggle because processes
                            and detail aren’t their strengths. Nevertheless, there are simple solutions you can get the
                            entire team involved,
                            alleviate pressure, and successfully employ new processes, policies, and systems. Besides,
                            the project you've been prolonging is a need not a want.
                        </p>
                        <p>I understand that within small businesses the teams have multiple priorities. That is the
                            best incentive to implementing more efficient processes,
                            policies, or systems. Typically, that one change will impact the functional area of each
                            employee within the business. Therefore, call everyone
                            to the table and tell them what you desire to implement, set a clear objective, and
                            collectively draft a project plan. Your local small business
                            administration or chamber of commerce has extensive resources to assist with project
                            planning and guiding your team. Besides, you can bring in a
                            consultant to guide the process, gain buy-in, or design the project planning process. Also,
                            several CRM companies host free classes on leveraging
                            their software to get desired results and increase efficiency. You have a variety of
                            resources at your disposal despite your budget, company size,
                            or revenue. Be mindful that once you get a standard project management process, then it can
                            be duplicated for future projects, no matter the size
                            of your new endeavor. Furthermore, it will empower your staff to provide their feedback and
                            become deeply invested in the success of the project
                            and business. Not to mention, you will gain a deeper understanding of your staff, their
                            hidden talents, and the strengths that didn’t make their
                            resume.</p>

                            <h1>Selling as a Mid-level Manager Bites</h1>
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <div class="comment_area">
                        <p>Every leader must be a salesman but sometimes it bites. We are constantly pushing new ideas,
                            products, services,
                            and processes. A component of our success depends on buy-in and an ability to sell the
                            vision. However, it presents
                            challenges to mid-level managers, at least it did for me and many others. Often, the vision
                            you're selling doesn’t
                            belong to you and you're not fully sold on it. Still, you must put on a smile, arm yourself
                            with charisma, stand in
                            front of your team, and deliver. If you fail to deliver by putting your ego and uncertainty
                            before the organization,
                            then the vision becomes lost. The adage says, where there is no vision, the people will
                            perish. Therefore, it is your
                            job to keep them focused and sell the vision of the company.
                        </p>
                        <p> <span class="fw-bold"> Plan for the objections.</span> A large part of being able to sell is
                            understanding objections. Therefore,
                            when I was skeptical about introducing a new idea, process, product, or service I wrote down
                            my
                            objections and the possible objections from my team. What made me feel uneasy or uncertain?
                            What do
                            I need to research or better understand? How does this impact current processes or
                            workflows? By
                            thinking through the objections, I became better prepared for conversations with my team and
                            senior
                            management. Also, it allowed me to see the concept from different perspectives and present
                            it from
                            an objective point of view.</p>
                        <p> <span class="fw-bold"> Choose to be a team player.</span> If you have played on any team
                            then you know the win isn’t always pretty.
                            Also, you know you will run some unsuccessful play, but your job is to stay in position.
                            Whether you agree
                            with the play or not, your team needs you to run it and run it to the best of your ability.
                        </p>
                        <p>My guiding principles weren’t just to assist me with selling to others. They assisted me with
                            selling it to myself so that
                            I could confidently gain buy-in from others. They helped me develop momentum and a positive
                            outlook to push new ideas,
                            products, services, or concepts regardless of my level of involvement and the reasoning
                            behind the plan. I was able to
                            remove my personal feelings and support my team and organization. Being a mid-level manager
                            can feel unmanageable,
                            but you can handle it. You have all of the necessary abilities to deliver and play your
                            position. Trust in your abilities
                            so that you can show up and perform at a high level. Remember, plan for the objections,
                            focus on the how versus the why,
                            and choose to be a team player to run the play and sell the vision. </p>

                        <p>In the words of Brene` Brown, you don’t get innovation without courage and vulnerability. 
                            A culture that thrives is where people aren’t afraid to make mistakes and take risks. Have you established
                             a culture where your team is okay with making critical decisions and thinking outside of the box? Do they
                              act courageously and are they comfortable with being vulnerable? If not, then don’t expect your business
                               to operate at the top of its game.
                        </p>
                        <p> <span class="fw-bold"> Plan for the objections.</span> A large part of being able to sell is
                            understanding objections. Therefore,
                            when I was skeptical about introducing a new idea, process, product, or service I wrote down
                            my
                            objections and the possible objections from my team. What made me feel uneasy or uncertain?
                            What do
                            I need to research or better understand? How does this impact current processes or
                            workflows? By
                            thinking through the objections, I became better prepared for conversations with my team and
                            senior
                            management. Also, it allowed me to see the concept from different perspectives and present
                            it from
                            an objective point of view.</p>
                        <p>  Calendar year 2020 was a year for the books. It stretched professionals across every industry to 
                            move outside the box and develop new ways to serve clients. Moreover, to seek ways to collaborate, stay connected, 
                            and provide traditional duties in non-traditional settings. Also, it required leaders to admit what they didn’t
                             know and empower their teams to make decisions and to make them quickly.
                        </p>
                        <p>Innovation isn’t just important during trying times. Innovation is a key component in any business
                             if it’s expected to excel. Innovation makes it possible to advance in the market, identify new opportunities, 
                             and maximize your profits. During a Masterclass interview, Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO said, the following:
                              “Innovation must be disruptive. And by disruptive, I mean disruptive. You gotta fracture and break the rules
                               and disrupt.” The well-known CEO understands the power of serving the basics in a way that feels cutting 
                               edge and leaves customers coming back for more.</p>
